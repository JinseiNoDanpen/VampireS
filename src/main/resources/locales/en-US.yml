# All string messages support Minecraft formatting codes, you can use, for example, "&cHello World!" to send a completely light red string.
# If you want to look at Minecraft's formatting codes to use them, visit this page:
# https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes

# If you leave a string option empty, the plugin will use the default one.
# To leave a string empty, just don't write ANYTHING on the part after the ":" of a string option.
# Leaving something like {""} will result in an empty message.

# "[prefix]" will be replaced with the plugin's prefix. ( the prefix is: "&7&l[&c&lVampireS&7&l] &8> " )

# "[perm]" will be replaced with the permission required to perform that action.

# "[displayname]" will be replaced with the involved player's displayname.
